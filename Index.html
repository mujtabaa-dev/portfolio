                <p>
                    Hello! I’m Mujtaba, a dedicated front-end developer and web penetration tester based in Baghdad. With a strong passion for both creating visually appealing websites and ensuring their security, I combine creativity with technical expertise to deliver
                    exceptional web experiences, From an early age, I was fascinated by the endless possibilities the web offered. This curiosity led me to dive deep into the world of web development, where I discovered my talent for front-end design.
                    I honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and quickly moved on to mastering modern frameworks such as React and Tailwind. As my journey progressed, I realized that creating beautiful websites was only half the battle. The other
                    half was ensuring that these websites were secure and resilient against potential threats. This realization steered me towards the field of web penetration testing, where I learned to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities, ensuring
                    that the websites I developed were not only visually stunning but also secure.</p>
